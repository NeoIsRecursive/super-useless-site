# Cool dice game

Yeah it just plays itself but I guess you can help?

# Installation

Just clone it and run index.html

# Code Review

1. Your site is very impressive and fun, and pretty useless! It was hard to find things to comment on, but here is a few:

In “functions.js” and in “index.js” on row 12 you could create element instead :) 

2. I like the font you have picked for your H1. Just remember to add the format woff2 when you insert the font, since it was a requirement in this assignment. Maybe you could have picked a font for your p-tags aswell? 

3. The assignment says that you should have your font as a variable. 

4. I would suggest that you don’t leave the “title” in index.html empty, add for example “Play dice” - for the semantics but also for the viewer so that they can have a clear navigation tab. A dice as a favicon would be fun aswell!

5. Your code is structured but it would be easier to read if you add comments!
